# Titanic - Machine Learning from disaster
As you know, the sinking of the most modern ship in the world at the time was quite a story. Despite the technology available, after hitting an iceberg on April 15th, 1912, it sank, killing a total of 1502 people out of its 2224 passengers.

The lack of lifeboats for crew and passengers as well as some irresponsible actions taken by the crew contributed to the disaster.

The survivors were obviously lucky, but were there any passengers that were "luckier" than others? Did women and children have a better chance of surviving? Did Jack have fewer chances of surviving than Rose, given the fact he was a 3rd class passenger?

With the real data available, we can do an exploratory analysis, test hypotheses, and build a predictive model.

In a nutshell, the goal of this challenge is to use the available data to measure the chances of surviving for every passenger on the Titanic.
